    <p class="blog content">
        It's been couple of months now since I started Bloc, it's been been both fun and challenging. Some topics are more abstract to grasp than others, such as Hoisting, prototypes inheritance, closure, etc. I enjoy coding in javascript comparing to python and java. JS is very lenient and versatile, sometimes to a point where you'd be breaking so many rules in other languages. Coding challenges, by far, has been the hardest parts along with the abstract concepts. They teach me to think differently, approaching a problem in a non-linear way.
